        <h2>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapters: 551 [200+ untranslated extra stories]</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
        <p>Kim Dokja does not consider himself the protagonist of his own life. Befitting the name his parents gave him,
            he is a solitary person whose sole hobby is reading web novels. For over a decade, he has lived vicariously
            through Yu Junghyeok, the main character of the web novel Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse (TWSA).
        </p>
        <p>
            Through Junghyeok, Dokja has experienced secondhand the trials of repeatedly regressing in time, in search
            of an end to life-threatening “scenarios” that force people to act out narratives for the amus**ent of
            god-like “Constellations.”
        </p>
        <p>
            After reading 3,149 chapters—long after all other readers lost interest—Dokja finally resigns himself to the
            story ending. However, he receives an enigmatic message from the author, stating that the story will soon be
            monetized, before his surroundings suddenly go dark.
        </p>
        <p>
            He swiftly realizes that fiction has become reality and he is now living through TWSA. Although he is the
            singular omniscient reader of the events yet to come, his success in the scenarios is not guaranteed—but
            perhaps his advantage will empower him to step into the protagonist role that never suited him before.</p>

        <p>With the rising tide of steam power and machinery, who can come close to being a Beyonder? Shrouded in the
            fog of history and darkness, who or what is the lurking evil that murmurs into our ears?</p>
        <p>Waking up to be faced with a string of mysteries, Zhou Mingrui finds himself reincarnated as Klein Moretti in
            an alternate Victorian-era world where he sees a world filled with machinery, cannons, dreadnoughts,
            airships, different machines, as well as Potions, Divination, Hexes, Tarot Cards, Sealed Artifacts…</p>
        <p>The Light continues to shine but mystery has never gone far. Follow Klein as he finds himself entangled with
            the Churches of the world—both orthodox and unorthodox—while he slowly develops newfound powers thanks to
            the Beyonder potions.</p>
        <p>Like the corresponding tarot card, The Fool, which is numbered 0—a number of unlimited potential—this is the
            legend of “The Fool”.</p>

            bond, despite risking the gods' wrath.</p>
        <p>They are trained by the centaur Chiron in the arts of war and medicine, but when word comes that Helen of
            Sparta has been kidnapped, all the heroes of Greece are called upon to lay siege to Troy in her name.
            Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for
            his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the cruel Fates will test them both as never before
            and demand a terrible sacrifice.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Volumes: 10[?]</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
        <p>Scorned by others of his kind for being born under a blue moon, the vampire Vanitas grew afraid and desolate.
            According to legend, he created a cursed grimoire known as the "Book of Vanitas," and it is said he would
            one day use it to bring retribution upon all vampires of the crimson moon.
        </p>
        <p>In 19th century Paris, Noé Archiviste is searching for the fabled Book of Vanitas. Whilst traveling aboard an
            airship, he is saved from a vampire attack by an eccentric doctor who calls himself Vanitas and carries the
            very tome he seeks. Ironically, the self-proclaimed vampire specialist is a mere human who inherited both
            his name and the book from his master, the same Vanitas of legend. As the odd case of the Charlatan's Parade
            crops up, the doctor's ability to restore sanity to vampires by recovering their true name will prove most
            beneficial.
